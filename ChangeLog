	* Changed the locking mechanism, now all access to t_node * structs
	are properly protected.

2004-04-15  Alexandre Carmel-Veilleux <acv@acv.ca>

	* Switched to threads. Alpha quality build, at best

	using the real value instead of the flag.

	from the user.

	* Very large modification. The entire architecture has been reworked
	so that authentications to the central server are performed in a
	fork()'d child process and the exit code from that child is then
	used to set the User Class of the connection.
	* The UserClasses (global definitions) and Rights (per connection)
	have been integrated.

2004-03-16  Mina Naguib <minaguib@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Changed HTTP server tasks to be handled by libhttpd - merged
	incorporate_libhttpd branch

2004-03-13  Philippe April <papril777@yahoo.com>
    * Modified the way firewall scripts are called so we can configure
    them in the config file (a bit more modular than it was)
    * Added simple linked list to keep track of clients and to
    keep a counter of the utilization and send it to the auth
    server
    * Fixed CRLF/formatting in phpauth/auth/index.php
    * Hacked phpauth/auth/index.php to handle very basic utilization tracking

2004-03-12  Philippe April <papril777@yahoo.com>
    * Changed all perror()s into debug()s and added
    errno.h to common.h

2004-03-10  Philippe April <papril777@yahoo.com>
    * Small fix to firewall.c so we don't define variables after
    the function has started (so it builds on gcc-2.95)

2004-03-09  Philippe April <papril777@yahoo.com>
    * Major changes: not forking anymore for new connections, now using
    select() instead. It will allow us to efficiently use a linked list to track
    users and other things. It introduces some bugs and design issues but will
    be better in the end.

2004-03-09  Philippe April <papril777@yahoo.com>
    * Small fix in the default.php login page
    * exit() where the program was supposed to exit but wasn't when the
    firewall could not be setup

2004-03-09  Alexandre Carmel-Veilleux <acv@acv.ca>
	* Tiny change to increase cross-platform compatibility. It can now build on OS X and it comes close to building on my old BSD box.

2004-03-08  Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
	* Initial CVS import.  Integrate a standrad GNU build system and Doxygen to the build process.  Add Doxygen and CVS headers, .cvsignores, etc.  Note that the imported code is Philippe April (papril777 at yahoo.com)'s work.  Tell me if I forgot anything.  Please note that the paths in the src/fw* scripts are still hardcoded.  Don't forget to update the ChangeLog file every commit and add doxygen comments to your code.  Happy hacking.
