	used to set the User Class of the connection.
	* The UserClasses (global definitions) and Rights (per connection)
	have been integrated.

2004-03-10  Philippe April <papril777@yahoo.com>
	* Small fix to firewall.c so we don't define variables after
	the function has started (so it builds on gcc-2.95)

2004-03-09  Philippe April <papril777@yahoo.com>
	* Major changes, not forking anymore for new connections, now using
	select() instead. It will allow us to efficiently use a linked list to track

	be better in the end.

2004-03-09  Philippe April <papril777@yahoo.com>
	* Small fix in the default.php login page

2004-03-08  Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
	* Initial CVS import.  Integrate a standrad GNU build system and Doxygen to the build process.  Add Doxygen and CVS headers, .cvsignores, etc.  Note that the imported code is Philippe April (papril777 at yahoo.com)'s work.  Tell me if I forgot anything.  Please note that the paths in the src/fw* scripts are still hardcoded.  Don't forget to update the ChangeLog file every commit and add doxygen comments to your code.  Happy hacking.
