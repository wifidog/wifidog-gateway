    * Major changes: not forking anymore for new connections, now using
    select() instead. It will allow us to efficiently use a linked list to track
    users and other things. It introduces some bugs and design issues but will
    be better in the end.

    * Small fix in the default.php login page
    * exit() where the program was supposed to exit but wasn't when the
    firewall could not be setup

	* Tiny change to increase cross-platform compatibility. It can now build on OS X and it comes close to building on my old BSD box.

	* Initial CVS import.  Integrate a standrad GNU build system and Doxygen to the build process.  Add Doxygen and CVS headers, .cvsignores, etc.  Note that the imported code is Philippe April (papril777 at yahoo.com)'s work.  Tell me if I forgot anything.  Please note that the paths in the src/fw* scripts are still hardcoded.  Don't forget to update the ChangeLog file every commit and add doxygen comments to your code.  Happy hacking.
