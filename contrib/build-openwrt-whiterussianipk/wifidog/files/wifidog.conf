# WiFiDog Configuration file

# Parameter: GatewayID
# Default: default
# Optional
#
# Set this to the node ID on the auth server
# This is used to give a customized login page to the clients and for
# monitoring/statistics purpose. If you run multiple gateways on the same
# machine each gateway needs to have a different gateway id.

# without the : separators

# GatewayID default

# Parameter: ExternalInterface

# Normally autodetected

# ExternalInterface eth0

# Parameter: GatewayInterface
# Default: NONE
# Mandatory
#
# Set this to the internal interface (typically your wifi interface).    
# Typically br0 for whiterussian, br-lan for kamikaze (by default the wifi interface is bridged with wired lan in openwrt)
# and eth1, wlan0, ath0, etc. otherwise
# You can get this interface with the ifconfig command and finding your wifi interface

# Parameter: Daemon
# Default: 1
# Optional
#
# Set this to true if you want to run as a daemon
# Daemon 1

# Parameter: GatewayPort
# Default: 2060
# Optional
#
# Listen on this port
# GatewayPort 2060

# Parameter: ProxyPort
# Default: 0 (disable)
# Optional
#
# Redirect http traffic of knowns & probations users
# to a local transparent proxy listening on ProxyPort port
# ProxyPort 0

# Default: WiFiDog
# Optional
#
# Define what name the HTTPD server will respond

# HTTPDUserName admin
# HTTPDPassword secret

# Parameter: CheckInterval
# Default: 60
# Optional
#
# How many seconds should we wait between timeout checks.  This is also
# how often the gateway will ping the auth server and how often it will
# update the traffic counters on the auth server.  Setting this too low
# wastes bandwidth, setting this too high will cause the gateway to take 
# a long time to switch to it's backup auth server(s).

# CheckInterval 60

FirewallRuleSet global {
    ## To block SMTP out, as it's a tech support nightmare, and a legal liability
    #FirewallRule block tcp port 25
    
    ## Use the following if you don't want clients to be able to access machines on 
    ## the private LAN that gives internet access to wifidog.  Note that this is not
    ## client isolation;  The laptops will still be able to talk to one another, as
    ## well as to any machine bridged to the wifi of the router.
    # FirewallRule block to 192.168.0.0/16
    # FirewallRule block to 172.16.0.0/12
    # FirewallRule block to 10.0.0.0/8
    
    ## This is an example ruleset for the Teliphone service.
    #FirewallRule allow udp to 69.90.89.192/27
    #FirewallRule allow udp to 69.90.85.0/27
    #FirewallRule allow tcp port 80 to 69.90.89.205
    
    ## Use the following to log or ulog the traffic you want to allow or block.
    # For OPENWRT: use of these feature requires modules ipt_LOG or ipt_ULOG present in dependencies
    # iptables-mod-extra and iptables-mod-ulog (to adapt it to the linux distribution).
    # Note: the log or ulog rule must be passed before, the rule you want to match.
    # for openwrt: use of these feature requires modules ipt_LOG or ipt_ULOG present in dependencies
    # iptables-mod-extra and iptables-mod-ulog
    # For example, you want to log (ulog works the same way) the traffic allowed on port 80 to the ip 69.90.89.205:
    #FirewallRule log tcp port 80 to 69.90.89.205
    #FirewallRule allow tcp port 80 to 69.90.89.205
    # And you want to know, who matche your block rule:
    #FirewallRule log to 0.0.0.0/0
    #FirewallRule block to 0.0.0.0/0
